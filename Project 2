    How to install:
    a.	Go to the website https://sylabs.io/singularity
    b.	Click “Get Now” under SingularityCE
    c.	Under Downloads, you will find the filename of “singularity-ce-3.8.3.tar.gz”. Download that file and save it to your Downloads folder.
    d.	Change your directory to “Downloads.” In order to unzip the tar file, you need to run the command “tar -xvf singularity-ce-3.8.3.tar.gz”.
    e.	Change your directory in your terminal to “singularity-ce-3.8.3”.
    f.	Run the command “chmod +x mconfig” to change the permissions of the file in order for you to be able to execute it later.
    g.	Scroll to the top of the page and find the sentence “Documentation is available at https://sylabs.io/docs” and click on that link. These are the instructions to install the container.
    h.	Find “v.3.8” and click on the HTML file under “User Guide”.
    i.	Scroll down to “Quick Installation Steps” and install all of the libraries the container needs to run (there should be 10 of them).
    j.	The container also needs “Go” to be installed. Click the link titled “Go to Downloads Page”.
    k.	Click the download titled “go1.17.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz”.
    l.	At the top of the page, there is a link that says “installation instructions.’ Click on the link.
    m.	You need to be root for these next couple of steps so run the command “sudo su” in your terminal and change your directory to “Downloads”.
    n.	On the website, copy and paste the command “rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.17.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz” into your terminal.
    o.	Copy and paste the next command into your terminal as well: “export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin”.
    p.	To verify that you correctly installed “Go”, run the command “go version” and you should see “go version go1.17.1 linux/amd64”.
    q.	Now change your directory to “singularity-ce-3.8.3” inside of the “Downloads” folder.
    r.	Now to compile the SinularityCE source code, run the following command:
    i.	“./mconfig && make -C builddir && sudo make -C builddir install”.
    s.	It will take a few minutes to install. Once it is finished run the command “singularity help” to see if it works!
